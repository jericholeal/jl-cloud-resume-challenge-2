      <h1>Hi, I'm Jericho.</h1>      
      
      <p>
        I'm an aspiring IT professional backed by seven years as an private online TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) teacher on iTalki.
        I've taken foundational steps, completing certifications (including the CompTIA A+ and AWS Cloud Practitioner), getting my hands on lab projects, 
        and developing a foundation in Linux, Windows, support tasks, system administration, and cloud computing.
        I've been self-taught and self-driven so far, but I know that the best growth happens in 
        collaborative environments where I can get feedback, absorb knowledge, and contribute as part of a team.
      </p>     
    
      <p>
        I'm currently looking for an IT support, help desk, or junior sysadmin position to serve as my launchpad, where I can contribute immediately, 
        gain real-world experience, and grow under great mentorship and alongside a great team. 
      </p>
