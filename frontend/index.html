      <h1>Hi, I'm Jericho.</h1>      
      
      <p>
        I'm launching my career in tech, pivoting from seven successful years as a private online English teacher.
        I've taken foundational steps, with completing certifications, getting my hands on lab projects, 
        and developing a foundation in Linux, Windows, support tasks, system administration skills, cloud computing, Infrastructure as Code, and CI/CD.
        I've been self-taught and self-driven so far, but I know that the best growth happens in 
        collaborative environments where I can get feedback, absorb knowledge, and contribute as part of a team.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <h3>Breaking into IT</h3>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm currently looking for an IT support, help desk, or junior sysadmin position to serve as my launchpad, where I can contribute immediately, 
        gain real-world experience, and continue to sharpen my skills under great mentorship and alongside a great team. 
      </p>
