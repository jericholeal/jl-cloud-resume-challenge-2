      <p>
        Embarking on this project was the first time I ever touched AWS cloud services and resources and hands-on cloud engineering.
        I dove into it with minimal prior knowledge about building things in the cloud, as the Cloud Resume Challenge originally intended.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h2>What I did and learned in attempt 1:</h2>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Primarily used the AWS Console and learned how things worked</li>
        <li>Re-discovered HTML, introduced to CSS and JavaScript</li>                
        <li>Hosted zones, DNSSEC</li>
        <li>Encryption at rest and in transit</li>
        <li>Serverless (Lambda, DynamoDB)</li>
        <li>CDNs, OAC, and CDN caching</li>
        <li>APIs and HTTP methods</li>
        <li>JSON</li>
        <li>How front and backends work together</li>        
        <li>How cloud resources connect, communicate, and fit together as a whole</li>
        <li>GitHub Actions, CI/CD</li>
        <li>First time really using Git and GitHub for version control on an actual project</li>
        <li>Terraform (Infrastructure as Code), as a challenge step was to convert manually-created resources into .tf configurations</li>
      </ul> 
      
      <p>
        <h2>Other notes:</h2>
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The resume on the live site of Take 1 is obviously very true, accurate, and realistic.
          (It was a placeholder that I threw in there while doing all the backend work and I decided to leave it like that when I started my second attempt.)</li>        
        <li>I actually <i>didn't</i> try to deploy the entire thing using Terraform as a later step prescribed.
          It was at this point that I decided to redo the entire thing (Take 2), but starting with Terraform from the get-go.
          I'm thinking about revisiting my Take 1 project again to mess around and improve on it with everything that I've learned so far.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <p>
        <h2>What changed between Take 1 and Take 2?</h2>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Primarily used AWS CLI rather than the console (about 95% of the time) using SSO login</li>
        <li>Used Terraform from the start rather than at the end</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I rehashed and improved on a lot of the configurations I made during Take 1</li>
            <li>I decided to take a modular approach</li>
            <li>I bootstrapped some key resources (e.g. Route53 hosted zone) and imported them before applying the entire Terraform configuration</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Redesigned the frontend, adding more pages and repurposing the site as more of a portfolio site rather than a resume</li>
        <li>Used OIDC roles for GitHub Actions workflows instead of stored credentials as repository secrets</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        <h2>What I learned the second time around:</h2>
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Terraform modular architecture (separate modules, variables & outputs, locals, tfvars, main.tf)</li>
        <li>Got more comfortable with HCL and writing Terraform configurations</li>
        <li>Importing existing resources with Terraform</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I tried terraform apply without importing my existing Route53 zone that I manually provisioned and it caused issues 
              (ACM certificate validation; Route53 creating new hosted zones and trying to validate with the wrong zone and NSs)</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Resource dependencies</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Ran into a lot of circular dependency problems (specifically with Route53, CloudFront, and S3)
          </ul>
        <li>OIDC roles</li>
        <li>More about least-privilege access</li>
        <li>That I can do what I set my mind to, even if at the start I'm not sure what I'm doing</li>
      </ul>
