      <p>
        Embarking on this project was the first time I ever touched AWS cloud services and resources and hands-on cloud engineering.
        I dove into it with minimal prior knowledge about building things in the cloud, as the Cloud Resume Challenge originally intended.
      </p>

      <h4>What I did and learned in attempt 1:</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Primarily used the AWS Console and learned how things worked</li>
        <li>Re-discovered HTML, introduced to CSS and JavaScript</li>                
        <li>Hosted zones, DNSSEC</li>
        <li>Encryption at rest and in transit</li>
        <li>Serverless (Lambda, DynamoDB)</li>
        <li>CDNs, OAC, and CDN caching</li>
        <li>APIs and HTTP methods</li>
        <li>JSON</li>
        <li>How front and backends work together</li>        
        <li>How cloud resources connect, communicate, and fit together as a whole</li>
        <li>GitHub Actions, CI/CD</li>
        <li>First time really using Git and GitHub for version control on an actual project</li>
        <li>Terraform (Infrastructure as Code), as a challenge step was to convert manually-created resources into .tf configurations</li>
      </ul> 
        
      <h4>Other notes:</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The resume on the live site of Take 1 is obviously very true, accurate, and realistic.
          (It was a placeholder that I threw in there while doing all the backend work and I decided to leave it like that when I started my second attempt.)</li>
        <li>For fun, I decided to do the simple auth page on the frontend to access the main index, plus an access denied page on incorrect password input
          (I'm aware it doesn't really protect anything, but it was for fun and I wanted to see if I could, so I did)
        </li>
        <li>I actually <i>didn't</i> try to deploy the entire thing using Terraform as a later step prescribed.
          It was at this point that I decided to redo the entire thing (Take 2), but starting with Terraform from the get-go.
          I'm thinking about revisiting my Take 1 project again to mess around and improve on it with everything that I've learned so far.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What changed between Take 1 and Take 2?</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Primarily used AWS CLI rather than the console (about 95% of the time) using SSO login</li>
        <li>Used Terraform from the start rather than at the end</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I rehashed and improved on a lot of the configurations I made during Take 1</li>
            <li>I decided to take a modular approach</li>
            <li>I bootstrapped some key resources (e.g. Route53 hosted zone) and imported them before applying the entire Terraform configuration</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Redesigned the frontend, adding more pages and repurposing the site as more of a portfolio site rather than a resume</li>
        <li>Used OIDC roles for GitHub Actions workflows instead of stored credentials as repository secrets</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>What I learned the second time around:</h4>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Terraform modular architecture (separate modules, variables & outputs, locals, tfvars, main.tf)</li>
        <li>Got more comfortable with HCL and writing Terraform configurations</li>
        <li>Importing existing resources with Terraform</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I tried terraform apply without importing my existing Route53 zone that I manually provisioned and it caused issues 
              (ACM certificate validation; Route53 creating new hosted zones and trying to validate with the wrong zone and NSs)</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Resource dependencies</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Ran into a lot of circular dependency problems (specifically with Route53, CloudFront, and S3)
          </ul>
        <li>OIDC roles</li>
        <li>More about least-privilege access</li>
        <li>That I can do what I set my mind to, even if at the start I'm not sure what I'm doing</li>
      </ul>
