      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I'm self-taught, results-oriented, and I learn fast.</p>
      <p>
        If there's something new to learn, don't give me a book about it.<br>
        I'll just do it, make mistakes, learn, and do it again.<br>
        And again. And again. Intentionally, purposefully, and inquisitively.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I did something wrong? I'll figure out why and do it right next time.<br>
        I forgot what that is? I'll dig into my notes and refresh my memory.<br>
        I don't know what that is or how to do it? I'll ask questions and try until I do.<br>
