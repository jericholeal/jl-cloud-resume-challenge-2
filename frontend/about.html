      <p>I'm self-taught, results-oriented, and I learn fast.</p>
      <p><b>Here's an illustration of how my mind works when it comes to learning:</b></p>        
      <p>
        Let's use woodworking as an example (I'm a self-taught woodworker).<br>
        I'm not the type of person who would study the history of the hammer, what it's made of, who invented it and how it works, and then try randomly hitting things with it.<br>
        I'd find an interesting woodworking project to build instead.<br>
        The project requires nails? OK, what do I need to work with nails? A hammer? What do I do with it? Hit the head of the nail? Ouch, I hit my finger. OK, I got the hang of it.<br>
        I have to use screws? Can I use this hammer? No, that doesn't work. A screwdriver? OK, how do I use that for this screw? Like this? Oh, OK, cool. I got it.<br>
        What's that? A <i>power drill</i>? That makes life <i>way</i> easier! What other "power" tools are there?<br>
        Project's done. Looks cool, but sloppy. Let's do another one.<br>
        Now, I know how to use a hammer, a screwdriver, and drill, and I'm ready to do something more challenging.
      </p>
      <p>You get the point.</p>
      <p>
        If there's something new to learn, I'd rather not just read about it.<br>
        I'll just do it, make mistakes, learn, and do it again.<br>
        And again. And again. Intentionally, purposefully, and inquisitively.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I did something wrong? I'll figure out why and do it right next time.<br>
        I forgot what something is? I'll dig into my notes and refresh my memory.<br>
        I don't know what that is or how to do it? I'll ask questions and try until I do.<br>
