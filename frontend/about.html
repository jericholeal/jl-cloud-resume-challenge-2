      <h2>Work Experience</h2>

      <p><h3>English as a Foreign Language Teacher | iTalki (Remote) | 2017-Present</h3></p>

      <p>
        I've worked independently for almost 8 years as an online English as Foreign Language (TEFL) teacher through iTalki. 
        I manage my schedule and rates, teach and coach clients worldwide, 
        and tailor my approach to individual goals, needs, levels, and backgrounds, 
        all while leveraging tools like Google Drive (Docs & Sheets), Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. 
        Over the years, I've obtained additional certificates to refine my craft 
        and deliver better service and outcomes. I've completed over 7,000 lessons to over 800 clients around the globe, 
        helping many surpass their IELTS targets, deepen their grammar skills, and build confidence. 
        This experience has solidified my comfort with remote work, digital platforms, and 
        self-led productivity.

      <p><h3>Activation Aide | Sienna Senior Living (Brampton, ON) | 2014-2017</h3></p>
      
      <p>
        Before that, I served as an Activation Aide in a long-term care facility, 
        where I designed and led resident programs, documented outcomes, designed care plans, 
        and collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to provide holistic and empathetic care and support. 
        I also assisted with additional tasks like beverage service, special events, and pet care. 
        I learned how to work under pressure, take initiative, stay attentive to detail, 
        and work alongside others toward a common goal.
