        <h4>My Path Into Tech</h4>
      </p>
      
      <p>I'm transitioning into tech with a clear long-term focus: building a career in cloud engineering.
        I've taken my first foundational steps, with completing certifications, getting my hands on projects, 
        and developing a foundation in Linux, AWS, Terraform, and system administration skills.</p>
      <p>Right now, I'm open to junior-level roles in IT support, help desk, 
        or junior sysadmin workâ€”positions where I can contribute immediately, 
        gain real-world experience, and continue to sharpen my skills. 
        Cloud roles demand both breadth and depth and I'm committed to earning that through consistent growth, 
        real-world problem-solving, and learning from more experienced teammates. 
        I've been self-taught and self-driven so far, but I know that the best growth happens in 
        collaborative environments where I can get feedback, absorb knowledge, and contribute as part of a team.</p>

      <p>
        <h4>My Professional Backstory</h4>
      </p>

      <p>
        I've worked independently for almost 8 years as an online English as Foreign Language (TEFL) teacher through iTalki. 
        I manage my schedule and rates, teach and coach clients worldwide, 
        and tailor my approach to individual goals, needs, levels, and backgrounds, 
        all while leveraging tools like Google Drive (Docs & Sheets), Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. 
        Over the years, I've obtained additional certificates to refine my craft 
        and deliver better service and outcomes. I've completed over 7,000 lessons to over 800 clients around the globe, 
        helping many surpass their IELTS targets, deepen their grammar skills, and build confidence. 
        This experience has solidified my comfort with remote work, digital platforms, 
        self-led productivity, and global collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before that, I served as an Activation Aide in a long-term care facility, 
        where I designed and led resident programs, documented outcomes, designed care plans, 
        and collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to provide holistic and empathetic care and support. 
        I also assisted with additional tasks like beverage service, special events, and pet care. 
        I learned how to work under pressure, take initiative, stay attentive to detail, 
        and work alongside others toward a common goal.
      </p>    

      <p>
        <h4>My Approach To Learning</h4>
      </p>        
      
      <p>I'm results-oriented and use the ends to determine the means.</p>

      <p>Let's take woodworking as an illustration:
        I don't want to read the history of the hammer or study how they're made.
        I want to build something. If I need to drive in nails, I grab a hammer and learn by doing, 
        even if I miss or slam my thumb a few times. 
        A hammer doesn't work for screws, does it? 
        I need to reach for a screwdriver. 
        A screwdriver feels kind of slow? 
        I can make use of a power drill. 
        Each tool leads to better results and sparks curiosity about what else is out there. 
        The more I build, the more I understand, and the faster I grow.        
      </p>
